Certainly! Below is a simple example of a Java login code using a basic username and password validation approach:

java
Copy code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class LoginSystem {
    // Dummy database storing valid usernames and passwords
    private static final String[][] DATABASE = {
            {"user1", "password1"},
            {"user2", "password2"}
    };

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Login System!");

        boolean loggedIn = false;

        while (!loggedIn) {
            System.out.print("Enter username: ");
            String username = scanner.nextLine();
            System.out.print("Enter password: ");
            String password = scanner.nextLine();

            if (isValidLogin(username, password)) {
                System.out.println("Login successful! Welcome, " + username + "!");
                loggedIn = true;
            } else {
                System.out.println("Invalid username or password. Please try again.");
            }
        }

        // Code after successful login
        // This is where you would put the functionality of your application after successful login
    }

    private static boolean isValidLogin(String username, String password) {
        for (String[] user : DATABASE) {
            if (user[0].equals(username) && user[1].equals(password)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
This code demonstrates a simple login system where users are prompted to enter their username and password. The entered credentials are then compared against a hardcoded database of valid usernames and passwords. If a match is found, the user is considered logged in. Otherwise, they are prompted to try again. Note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include features like password hashing or database connectivity. In real-world scenarios, you'd want to use more secure practices.

java code for payment

Here's a basic Java code example for a payment system:

java
Copy code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PaymentSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Payment System!");

        // Ask user for payment amount
        System.out.print("Enter the payment amount: ");
        double amount = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Ask user for payment method
        System.out.println("Select payment method:");
        System.out.println("1. Credit Card");
        System.out.println("2. Debit Card");
        System.out.println("3. PayPal");
        System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");
        int choice = scanner.nextInt();
